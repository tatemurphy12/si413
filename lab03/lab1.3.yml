    I finished all my helper functions and changed the way I read them in. I realized that it would be smarter to scan in the functions from the file directly rather than hard-coding them in. I figured out a way to keep track of my string declarations using a counter and an ArrayList of unique Strings to deal with reverses and concatenations. I then had to edit my reverse helper function because it reversed the string in place intstead of creating a new local buffer. This created a segfault when I would try to reverse globally declared Strings.
