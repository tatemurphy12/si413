    Stash Booty correctPass ~~backwards~~

    !Blimey! Get the secret input from the user. They should type in "sdrawkcab" Scallywag!
    Avast Booty ~~Enter the password or walk the plank!~~
    Stash Booty userInput Savvy?

    !Blimey!
        Now, we check if the REVERSED user input is the same as the correct password!
        Swab userInput --> should become "backwards" if typed correctly
        Cog ![ Swab userInput ]! correctPass --> should return true (Aye!)
    Scallywag!
    Avast Loot Cog ![ Swab userInput ]! correctPass

    !Blimey! Let's sail the seven seas with lots of tildes
             by putting dots in the string delimiters.  Scallywag!
