Generate a java regex that defines a string as any number of regular characters between two square brackets, using \ as an escape character

Gemini:

Here's the Java regex to define a string as any number of characters between two square brackets, using \ as an escape character.

Java

"^\\[(?:[^\\]\\\\]|\\\\.)*\\]$"
Breakdown of the Regex
This regular expression ensures that the entire string matches the specified pattern from start to finish.

^: Asserts the position at the start of the string.

\\[: Matches the literal opening square bracket [. It's escaped with a backslash because [ has a special meaning in regex.

(?: ... )*: This is a non-capturing group (?: ... ) that matches the inner pattern zero or more times *. It looks for:

[^\\]\\\\]: This is a character class that matches any single character except a closing bracket ] or a backslash \.

Inside a Java string, \\] becomes \\] (to escape the regex special character ]).

\\\\ becomes \\ (to match a literal backslash \).

|: This acts as an "OR".

\\\\.: This matches a literal backslash \ followed by any character. This handles the escaped characters like \[, \], or \\.

\\]: Matches the literal closing square bracket ].

$: Asserts the position at the end of the string.

Example Usage in Java
Here is how you would use this regex in a Java program to validate strings.

Java

import java.util.regex.Pattern;

public class RegexExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // The regex pattern
        String pattern = "^\\[(?:[^\\]\\\\]|\\\\.)*\\]$";

        // --- Test Cases ---

        // Valid strings
        System.out.println(Pattern.matches(pattern, "[]"));             // true (empty)
        System.out.println(Pattern.matches(pattern, "[hello]"));        // true (regular characters)
        System.out.println(Pattern.matches(pattern, "[a\\]b]"));        // true (escaped closing bracket)
        System.out.println(Pattern.matches(pattern, "[a\\\\[b]"));      // true (escaped backslash and escaped opening bracket)
        System.out.println(Pattern.matches(pattern, "[a\\\"b]"));        // true (escaped quote)

        System.out.println("--------------------");

        // Invalid strings
        System.out.println(Pattern.matches(pattern, "[hello"));         // false (no closing bracket)
        System.out.println(Pattern.matches(pattern, "hello]"));         // false (no opening bracket)
        System.out.println(Pattern.matches(pattern, "prefix[hello]"));  // false (extra characters at the start)
        System.out.println(Pattern.matches(pattern, "[hello]suffix"));  // false (extra characters at the end)
        System.out.println(Pattern.matches(pattern, "[a]b]"));          // false (unescaped closing bracket inside)
    }
}
