    I changed the entire structure of my program.
    I changed it to read in each statement char by char, adding
    literals and commands to an ArrayList, instead of
    using a Stack. This was to solve the problem I 
    encountered with commands showing up in the middle
    of the expression, instead of solely at the end.
